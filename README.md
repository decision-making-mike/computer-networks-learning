I have read up to page 95.

Let me talk a bit about my reading speed. So far, my average reading speed equals $((95 - 1) pages) / ((2024-12-10 - 2024-11-24 + 1) days) = (95 pages / 17 days) \approx 5.6 pages / day$. The book has 816 pages, that is, according to the publisher and my counting. I'm not going to read the parts containing the index and sources, so excluding their pages there is 768 pages left. Excluding the read 94 pages, I'm left with 674 pages. If I continue reading at this speed, I will read the whole book in $(674 pages) / (5.6 pages / day) \approx 120 days \approx 4 months$. So, I will complete the book in the first half of April 2025. Acceptable.

Now, the maximum reading speed I feel I can currently aim for is about $8.5 pages / day$. This speed will let me to complete those 674 pages in about $(674 pages) / (8.5 pages / day) \approx 79 days$. If we compare it to the average speed calculated above, this is about $((120 - 79) / 120) \approx 1/3$ better. We'll see how I'll be doing.

Today I started the blog. Also, I started reading a book "Sieci komputerowe. Ujęcie całościowe", by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross. See https://helion.pl/ksiazki/sieci-komputerowe-ujecie-calosciowe-wydanie-vii-james-kurose-keith-ross,sieu6v.htm#format/d. I have read up to page 25, thereby completing the parts "O autorach" and "Przedmowa".
